# SE-Scripts
A collection of scripts pertaining to maintaining and managing Space Engineers on Linux


## Prefix tool
prefixxer.sh is the script that can autodetect your SE prefix folder and install dotnet48 to it.
This improves mod compatibility, script compiling, multiplayer and performance (sim speed and FPS)


## Plugin Loader
to install no fuss:

`curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/geraveoyomama/SE-Scripts/refs/heads/main/plugin-installer.sh | bash`

plugin-installer.sh is the script that autodetects your SE's Bin64 folder and automatically installs SpaceEngineersLauncher for plugins and the Linux specific script.



# Usage

For dotnet48 clone the repo and run prefixxer.sh

For pluginloader to work dotnet48 needs to be installed first.

To install pluginloader clone the repo (if not already done) and run plugin-installer.sh
